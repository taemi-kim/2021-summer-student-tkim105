I haven't changed any of the given functions.
I tried my best to deal with what's given as best as I can. I hope I can be more creative next time to confidently have something outstanding.

I'm not perfectly confident with the printError() function since prints  slightly different from the requirement. I wasn't sure how arg[] pointer parameter was supposed to be used in the function, so I used it as part of the output statement instead.

Thank you so much for staying patient with my process of catching up.
